@mdo :

Use soft tabs with two spaces—they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements—the HTML5 spec says they're optional.
Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. </li> or </body>).
