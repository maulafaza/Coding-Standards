<sup>Status: **under discussion** </sup>

Quickly and easily ensure proper rendering of your content by declaring an explicit character encoding. When doing so, you may avoid using character entities in your HTML, provided their encoding matches that of the document (generally UTF-8).

```
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
```
