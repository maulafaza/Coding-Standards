[@mdo](http://codeguide.co/#css-comments) :

Code is written and maintained by people. Ensure your code is descriptive, well commented, and approachable by others. 
Great code comments convey context or purpose. Do not simply reiterate a component or class name.

Be sure to write in complete sentences for larger comments and succinct phrases for general notes.

```
/* Bad example */
/* Modal header */
.modal-header {
  ...
}

/* Good example */
/* Wrapping element for .modal-title and .modal-close */
.modal-header {
  ...
}
```
