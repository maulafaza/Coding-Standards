<sup>Status: **recommendation**</sup>

Refer to [Plugin Creation](https://github.com/contactjavas/Coding-Standards/tree/master/wp/plugin-creation/#one-plugin-for-one-business), it's RECOMMENDED to use 1 framework for 1 (*or few*) business.

But, sometimes we would like to work on some (more than 1) project's feature using framework. In this case, you are FREE to choose more complete framework.
