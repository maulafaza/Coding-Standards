Born Digital Coding Standards
===

WordPress already has own [complete standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) that cover *PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*. But we're coming from different references. It raises some *point of view* which is interesting to discuss.

### List of conventions:

 * [WordPress & PHP](https://github.com/contactjavas/Coding-Standards/tree/master/wp/)
 * [JavaScript](https://github.com/contactjavas/Coding-Standards/tree/master/js/)
 * [CSS](https://github.com/contactjavas/Coding-Standards/tree/master/css/)

### Contribution

 * Or pull request if you want to contribute about: code, word, formatting, & language correction
