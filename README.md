Born Digital Coding Standards
===

WordPress already has own [complete standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) that cover *PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*. But we're open to other's coding standards. It makes us open-minded and even give us better style :)

With these standards, at least we can:
 * Unify coding styles
 * Control the code's quality
 * Provide guide list to the team

So that we can achieve our goals:
 * Uniformity
 * Compatability between the project-developers and projects
 * Same standard - easy to maintain, creator does not have to maintain
 * Code is tighty, tidy
 * Professional â€“ big companies, should be as professional as professional
 * Less mistakes
 * Faster to code
 * More secure
 * Better time estimation
